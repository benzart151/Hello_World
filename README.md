Hello World

It's me Ben and I'm freaked about this bad ass hurricane heading our way. I have options I can ride upstate witb my freinds or weather the storm here both options scare me. Fuel is scarce and traffic is bad. Where I live there's nothing protecting the windows. My neigbor has storm shutters but he's got a roof that can be ripped off by a hurricane like this. So what should I do. I can also go to a shelter. Which is what I was planning to do. Wish me the best which ever my choice and I wish you the same.
